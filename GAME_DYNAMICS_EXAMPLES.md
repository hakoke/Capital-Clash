});
```

{
  "accepted": true

## üé≠ Player Custom Actions - Create Storylines

### Example 3: Create Brothel + Visit + Scandal
```
Round 1:
You: Create "Red Light District" in Downtown
AI: "Exclusive entertainment venue opens. +$50k revenue, -5 rep"
Frontend: News appears, your capital +$50k, board shows new building

Round 2:
Player B: Visit your establishment
AI: "CEO caught visiting! Photos leaked. -$10k, -15 rep"
Frontend: Breaking news, Player B loses money & rep, you get paid

Round 3:
You: Create scandal about the visit
AI: "SCANDAL EXPLODES! CEO career ruined. -$500k legal fees, -50 rep, ELIMINATED"
Frontend: Player B eliminated, moves to spectator mode, you profit
```

**How it works:**
```javascript
// You create brothel
POST /api/player-actions/:yourId/custom-action
{
  "actionType": "create_establishment",
  "actionDescription": "Opening exclusive entertainment venue",
  "details": { "type": "red_light_district" }
}

// AI responds dynamically:
{
  "eventTitle": "Red Light District Opens in Downtown",
  "consequences": {
    "actionPlayer": { "capitalChange": 50000, "reputationChange": -5 }
  }
}
// Your capital: $1M ‚Üí $1.05M
// Your rep: 50 ‚Üí 45
// Frontend shows this instantly

// Player B visits
POST /api/player-actions/:playerBId/custom-action
{
  "actionType": "visit",
  "targetPlayerId": "your_id",
  "actionDescription": "Visiting your establishment"
}

// AI creates SCANDAL:
{
  "eventTitle": "CEO CAUGHT! Photos Leaked to Paparazzi",
  "consequences": {
    "actionPlayer": {
      "capitalChange": -10000,
      "reputationChange": -15,
      "statusEffects": ["caught_visiting"]
    },
    "targetPlayer": {
      "capitalChange": 10000,
      "reputationChange": -5
    }
  },
  "marketReactions": { "downtown": -2 }
}
// Player B: $1M ‚Üí $990k, rep 50 ‚Üí 35
// You: $1.05M ‚Üí $1.06M
// Downtown: value drops 2%
// Frontend: All updates instantly

// You escalate scandal
POST /api/player-actions/:yourId/custom-action
{
  "actionType": "create_scandal",
  "targetPlayerId": "playerB_id",
  "actionDescription": "Leaking surveillance footage",
  "details": { "scandalType": "moral_corruption" }
}

// AI makes it WORSE:
{
  "eventTitle": "NUCLEAR SCANDAL: CEO Career Destroyed!",
  "consequences": {
    "actionPlayer": {
      "capitalChange": 100000,  // You profit big
      "reputationChange": -20
    },
    "targetPlayer": {
      "capitalChange": -500000,  // Legal fees, settlements
      "reputationChange": -50,    // Career over
      "statusEffects": ["eliminated", "disgraced", "bankrupt"]
    }
  },
  "marketReactions": {
    "downtown": -30  // District destroyed by scandal
  },
  "playerMessages": {
    "actionPlayer": "You destroyed a rival! +$100k",
    "targetPlayer": "You've been ELIMINATED. Spectate now."
  }
}
// Player B: BANKRUPT! ELIMINATED!
// Status shows: "üö® ELIMINATED - DISGRACED"
// Can only spectate now
// You: +$100k profit
// Frontend shows elimination message, spectate mode activates
```

**Frontend shows:**
- ‚úÖ News: "NUCLEAR SCANDAL: CEO Career Destroyed!"
- ‚úÖ Player B: Status badge "ELIMINATED üö®"
- ‚úÖ Player B: Can spectate, sees: "You've been eliminated"

```

You: Create "Coalition" establishment
Player B: Invests in your establishment

Round 3:
You: Chat "I'm selling out to our rival"
Player B: Chat "No! We had a deal!"
You: Betray Player B - leak their secrets
AI: "COALITION CRUMBLES! Player B loses trust, -100k"
Frontend: Player B eliminated, you profit
```

**How it works:**
```javascript
// You create alliance
POST /api/chat/message
{ "gameId": "game_123", "playerId": "your_id", "message": "Let's team up?" }

POST /api/player-actions/:yourId/custom-action
{
  "actionType": "create_alliance",
  "actionDescription": "Forming coalition",
  "details": { "partner": "player_b_id" }
}

// Player B joins
POST /api/player-actions/:playerBId/custom-action
{
  "actionType": "join_alliance",
  "targetPlayerId": "your_id",
  "actionDescription": "Investing in coalition"
}

// Later you betray
POST /api/player-actions/:yourId/custom-action
{
  "actionType": "betrayal",
  "targetPlayerId": "player_b_id",
  "actionDescription": "Leaking their secrets to rivals"
}

// AI creates betrayal event:
{
  "eventTitle": "ALLIANCE BETRAYED! Secrets Leaked!",
  "consequences": {
    "actionPlayer": {
      "capitalChange": 200000,  // You profit
      "reputationChange": -30    // You're ruthless
    },
    "targetPlayer": {
      "capitalChange": -300000,  // They lose everything
      "reputationChange": -100,  // Utter destruction
      "statusEffects": ["betrayed", "eliminated"]
    }
  },
  "storyline": "The coalition has crumbled. Corporate espionage exposed."
}
// Player B: ELIMINATED!
// Can spectate
// You: +$200k, -30 rep
// Frontend: Shows betrayal, elimination, spectate mode
```

## üíº Complex Business Scenarios

### Example 5: Hostile Takeover
```
You: "I want to buy out Player B's company"
You: Send trade offer with $1M capital
Player B: Rejects
You: Create scandal about their company
Player B: Company value crashes
You: Make new offer with $500k
Player B: Desperate, accepts
You: Now own their company!
```

**How it works:**
```javascript
// Attempt trade
POST /api/trading/offer
{
  "offerType": "company_trade",
  "offerDetails": {
    "offerCapital": 1000000,
    "wantCompanyId": "player_b_company_id"
  }
}
// Player B rejects

// Create scandal to destroy their company value
POST /api/player-actions/:yourId/custom-action
{
  "actionType": "corporate_espionage",
  "targetPlayerId": "player_b_id",
  "actionDescription": "Leaking their toxic waste scandal"
}

// AI response:
{
  "consequences": {
    "targetPlayer": {
      "capitalChange": -500000,  // Their company loses value
      "reputationChange": -40,
      "statusEffects": ["under_investigation"]
    }
  },
  "marketReactions": {
    "industrial_zone": -25  // Their district crashes
  }
}
// Player B's company valuation drops
// Frontend shows investigation, reputation crash

// Try trade again
POST /api/trading/offer
{
  "offerCapital": 500000  // Lower offer
}
// Player B desperate, accepts
// You now own their company!
// Database updates
// Frontend: You gain company, Player B loses it
