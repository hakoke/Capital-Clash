# ü§ñ AI System Details

## Model Choice: GPT-4

**Current Model**: GPT-4 via OpenAI API

### Why GPT-4?

1. **Superior Reasoning**: GPT-4 is OpenAI's most advanced model with better logical reasoning
2. **JSON Mode**: Supports structured JSON responses for game events
3. **Context Understanding**: Better at understanding complex game state and making relevant decisions
4. **Follows Instructions**: Much better at following detailed prompts than GPT-3.5
5. **Quality Output**: More creative and contextually aware responses

**Comparison**:
- GPT-3.5: Cheaper but less reliable, weaker instruction following
- GPT-4: More expensive but smarter, better for complex games
- GPT-4 Turbo: Faster version if speed is a concern

**For this game, GPT-4 is the best choice** because:
- We need intelligent, context-aware decisions
- JSON structured responses are critical
- Quality > speed for this use case

## Safety & Content Filtering

### ‚úÖ What's Protected

**Content Moderation**:
- Blocks keywords: murder, kill, hitman, porn, sex, explicit content, violence, drugs, weapons, etc.
- User inputs are sanitized before reaching the AI
- Company names, player names, and user actions are filtered

**OpenAI Built-in Safeguards**:
- GPT-4 has built-in content policy that refuses inappropriate requests
- The API will reject violent, sexual, or illegal content
- Safety systems are active at the API level

**Game-Specific Protection**:
- All user inputs pass through `sanitizeInput()` function
- Blocked keywords list filters inappropriate content
- AI prompts explicitly instruct: "No violence, explicit content, or illegal activities"

### üõ°Ô∏è How It Works

```javascript
// User tries to name company "Drugs Inc" or "Porn Store"
// System detects blocked keywords
// Automatically replaces with "A standard business"
const sanitizedName = aiService.sanitizeInput(userInput);
```

**OpenAI Safety Layer**:
- Even if something slips through, GPT-4 will refuse inappropriate requests
- API returns error or sanitized response
- Built-in AI safety guardrails

## Smart AI Decisions

### ‚ùå NOT Random

The AI makes decisions based on **REAL game state**:

```javascript
// Market Analysis
{
  totalCapital: $3,000,000,      // Actual total player capital
  ownedTiles: 12,                // Real tile ownership count
  averageDistrictValue: $250,000,  // Calculated from actual values
  marketHealth: 'booming'          // Based on real data
}
```

**Decision Process**:
1. **Analyzes actual game state**: Player capital, district values, owned properties
2. **Calculates market health**: Booming/Stable/Recession based on real data
3. **Makes contextual decisions**: 
   - If market is booming ‚Üí generates correction events
   - If players have high capital ‚Üí investment opportunities
   - If someone is struggling ‚Üí targeted aid events

### Example Intelligence

**Scenario**: Player has $2M capital, owns 8 tiles, round 6/8

**AI Thinks**:
- High capital = can handle riskier investments
- Late game = strategic consolidation important
- Many tiles = diversification opportunities

**AI Suggests**: 
- "Invest in Tech Park - you're well-diversified elsewhere"
- OR "Launch new AI company - you have capital for R&D"
- NOT random!

## Logging System

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Logging

All AI operations are logged:

```javascript
[AI EVENT] 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z: Generating market event
[AI EVENT Data]: {
  "round": 3,
  "marketHealth": "booming",
  "totalCapital": 3000000
}

[AI OPENAI] 2024-01-15T10:30:01Z: Sending request to GPT-4
[AI EVENT] 2024-01-15T10:30:02Z: Event generated successfully
```

**What's Logged**:
- All AI requests to OpenAI
- Market analysis before decisions
- Generated events and responses
- Errors and fallbacks
- Player action suggestions

**Check Logs**:
```bash
# Backend console shows all AI operations
cd backend
npm run dev
# Watch the console for [AI...] logs
```

## How AI Makes Decisions

### Step 1: Analyze Real Data

```javascript
// Calculate actual market health
const marketHealth = {
  totalCapital: sum all player.capital,
  districtValues: avg district.market_value,
  ownedProperties: count owned tiles,
  playerCount: number of players
}
```

### Step 2: Contextual Prompt

AI receives **real data**:
- Actual player capitals (not random numbers)
- Real district values (calculated from game state)
- Current round (affects decision types)
- Player reputation scores
- Owned vs available tiles

### Step 3: Smart Decision

AI considers:
- Can this player afford this suggestion?
- Is this the right time in the game?
- What would make the game more interesting?
- What's fair based on current positions?

### Step 4: Validation

- Checks response has required fields
- Validates data types are correct
- Falls back to safe defaults if invalid

## Example AI Decisions

### Scenario 1: Booming Market
**State**: High district values, $5M total capital, round 3/8
**AI Event**: "Tech regulation announced - Tech Park values drop -20%"
**Why**: Creates interesting tension, balances the market

### Scenario 2: Struggling Player
**State**: Player has $500k, lowest in game, owns 2 tiles
**AI Event**: "Government stimulus package - struggling businesses get grants"
**Why**: Helps underdog, keeps game competitive

### Scenario 3: Late Game
**State**: Round 7/8, all tiles owned, players have $10M+ each
**AI Event**: "Merger rumors - companies above $8M valuation get offers"
**Why**: Creates endgame excitement, strategic choices

**NOT Random!** Each decision is calculated from actual game state.
