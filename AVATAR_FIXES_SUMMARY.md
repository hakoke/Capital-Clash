# Avatar Selection Fixes - poordown.oi

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Eyes Only Show on Selected Avatar
**Problem**: Eyes were showing on all available avatars  
**Fix**: Changed logic from `{!isTaken && (` to `{isSelected && (` in `Lobby.jsx`  
**Result**: Eyes now ONLY appear when you click/select a color

### 2. ✅ Eyes Perfectly Centered
**Problem**: Eyes were in bottom-right corner, one eye was hidden  
**Fix**: Updated `.poordown-avatar-eyes` positioning in CSS:
```css
position: absolute;
top: 50%;
left: 50%;
transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
```
**Result**: Eyes are now perfectly centered in the avatar

### 3. ✅ Improved 3D Avatar Appearance
**Changes Made**:
- **Better gradients**: Added multiple radial gradients for depth
  - Top-left highlight (white) for glossy effect
  - Bottom-right shadow (black) for depth
  - Center-to-edge gradient darkening for spherical look
- **Enhanced shadows**: Multiple layered box-shadows
  - Outer drop shadows for elevation
  - Inset shadows for 3D curvature
  - Subtle inner highlights
- **Better gloss overlay**: 
  - Multiple radial gradients for realistic light reflection
  - Changed from `screen` to `overlay` blend mode
  - Positioned at 22% 20% (upper-left) like real sphere lighting
- **Color depth**: Uses `color-mix()` to darken the base color toward edges

**Result**: Avatars now look like shiny, glossy 3D spheres with realistic lighting

### 4. ✅ Smaller Avatar Size
**Change**: Reduced from 72px to 64px  
**Result**: More compact, better fits the grid layout

### 5. ✅ Solid Modal Background (Doesn't Blend with Board)
**Problem**: Modal was too transparent, board showed through  
**Fixes**:
- Increased card background opacity from 0.96/0.95 to 0.98/0.98
- Made ambient background more opaque (0.95 opacity)
- Added solid dark radial gradient in center of ambient
- Increased backdrop-filter blur from 18px to 28px
- Darkened the overlay gradients

**Result**: Modal now has a solid, opaque background that doesn't let the board show through

### 6. ✅ Enhanced Selection Ring
**Addition**: When selected, avatar gets:
- 3px glowing ring in cyan color
- Pulsing animation
- Enhanced glow effects
- More prominent shadow

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

### CSS Classes Updated
- `.poordown-selection-card` - More opaque background

- `.poordown-avatar-eyes` - Perfect centering
- `.poordown-avatar-circle--selected` - Ring and glow
- `@keyframes poordown-avatar-pulse` - Smooth animation

### Key CSS Techniques Used
1. **Multiple radial gradients** for 3D sphere effect
2. **Layered box-shadows** (4-6 layers) for depth
3. **color-mix()** function for color darkening
4. **mix-blend-mode: overlay** for realistic gloss
5. **transform: translate(-50%, -50%)** for perfect centering
6. **Multiple backdrop layers** for solid background

## Visual Result
