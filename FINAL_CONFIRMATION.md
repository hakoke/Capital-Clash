## 🎯 Here's EXACTLY How It Works:

### 1. You Create a Brothel:
```javascript
POST /api/player-actions/:yourId/custom-action
{
  "actionType": "create_establishment",
  "actionDescription": "Opening exclusive entertainment venue",
  "details": { "type": "brothel" }
}

// AI responds:
{
  "eventTitle": "Red Light District Opens in Downtown",
  "consequences": {
    "actionPlayer": {
      "capitalChange": 50000,  // You make money
      "reputationChange": -5   // Mixed reactions
    }
  }
}

// Frontend shows:
✅ News: "Red Light District Opens"
✅ Your capital: +$50k
✅ Board: Downtown gets special marker
```

### 2. Another Player Visits:
```javascript
POST /api/player-actions/:theirId/custom-action
{
  "actionType": "visit",
  "targetPlayerId": "your_id",
  "actionDescription": "Visiting your establishment",
  "details": {}
}

// AI responds with SCANDAL:
{
  "eventTitle": "CEO CAUGHT Visiting Red Light District!",
  "consequences": {
    "actionPlayer": {
      "capitalChange": -10000,   // They paid you
      "reputationChange": -15,     // Public scandal!
      "statusEffects": ["caught"]
    },
    "targetPlayer": {
      "capitalChange": 10000,    // You got paid
      "reputationChange": -5      // You also damaged
    }
  },
  "playerMessages": {
    "actionPlayer": "YOU WERE CAUGHT! Photos leaked. Reputation destroyed.",
    "targetPlayer": "You profited from the scandal"
  }
}

// Frontend shows:
✅ BREAKING NEWS: "CEO CAUGHT"
✅ Visitor: -$10k, -15 reputation, STATUS: "CAUGHT" 🚨
✅ You: +$10k
✅ News panel: Full story
✅ All players see it instantly
```

### 3. You Create MORE Scandal:
```javascript
POST /api/player-actions/:yourId/create-scandal
{
  "targetPlayerId": "their_id",
  "scandalType": "moral_corruption",
  "scandalDetails": "Leaking footage to media"
}

// AI creates DRAMATIC event:
{
  "eventTitle": "SCANDAL: Footage Leaked - CEO Career Over",
  "consequences": {
    "actionPlayer": {
      "capitalChange": 100000,   // You profit big
      "reputationChange": -20    // You're ruthless
    },
    "targetPlayer": {
      "capitalChange": -500000,  // Legal fees, settlements
      "reputationChange": -50,    // CAREER DESTROYED
      "statusEffects": ["eliminated", "disgraced", "bankrupt"]
    }
  },
  "marketReactions": {
    "downtown": -30  // District in chaos
  },
  "storyline": "The scandal has ruined careers. Government investigating. Stock market crash."
}

// Frontend shows:
✅ HEADLINE: "SCANDAL: CEO Career Over"
✅ Target: BANKRUPT! ELIMINATED! -$500k, -50 reputation
✅ You: +$100k profit, -20 reputation
✅ Board: Downtown -30% (district devastated!)
✅ Target player: "You've been ELIMINATED. Spectate now."
✅ Leaderboard: You win, they're destroyed
```
