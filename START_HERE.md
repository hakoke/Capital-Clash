## âš¡ Super Quick Setup

### Step 1: Create Backend .env File (1 minute)

**IMPORTANT**: You need to manually create this file because of security restrictions.

1. Navigate to: `backend/` folder
2. Create a new file named: `.env`
3. Copy and paste this content:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:AYhhQrfUuwqFrfIFBMPuiEjniySfuYIr@shortline.proxy.rlwy.net:40619/railway
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=capital_clash_secret_key_2024_super_secure_random_string
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
SOCKET_IO_PING_TIMEOUT=60000
SOCKET_IO_PING_INTERVAL=25000
MAX_PLAYERS_PER_GAME=6
MIN_PLAYERS_PER_GAME=2
TOTAL_ROUNDS=8
STARTING_CAPITAL=1000000
```

âœ… **Save the file!**

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

Open Terminal/PowerShell and run:

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Step 3: Set Up Database (1 minute)

```bash
cd backend
npm run db:setup
```

You should see: âœ… "Database schema created successfully!"
