## 🏢 PROPERTIES (Owned Tiles)

### Base Income per Round:
- **Normal districts:** 2% of property value per round
- **Booming districts:** 5% of property value per round  
- **Recession:** 1% of property value per round
- **Crisis:** -1% (YOU LOSE MONEY!)

### Example:
- Buy property for $300k in a **booming** Luxury Mile
- Income: $15,000 per round
- If market crashes to crisis → Income: -$3,000 per round (you lose money)

### Development Levels:
- Level 1 (branch) → +2% extra income
- Level 2 (office) → +4% extra income
- Level 3 (headquarters) → +6% extra income

**Total:** A fully developed luxury property in boom can give 11% per round!

## 🏭 COMPANIES

### Base Revenue per Round:
- Starts at 10% of investment value
- **Booming market:** 15% (1.5x multiplier)
- **Recession:** 5% (0.5x multiplier)
- **Crisis:** 2% (0.2x multiplier)

### Example:
- Launch company with $200k investment
- **Normal market:** $20k revenue, -$6k costs = $14k profit per round
- **Booming market:** $30k revenue, -$9k costs = $21k profit per round
- **Recession:** $10k revenue, -$3k costs = $7k profit per round
- **Crisis:** $4k revenue, -$1.2k costs = $2.8k profit per round

### Bankruptcy Risk:
- **Normal market:** 10% chance per round
- **Recession:** 15% chance per round
- **Crisis:** Company likely fails quickly

## 📈 INVESTMENTS (In Companies)

### When You Invest:
```javascript
// Example: Invest $300k in SolarCorp
UPDATE companies SET 
  valuation = valuation + 300000,
  revenue_per_round = revenue_per_round + 30000  // +10%
```

**Result:**
- Company value goes up
- Revenue per round increases by 10% of investment
- You get MORE money back each round
- Company is more likely to survive crashes
