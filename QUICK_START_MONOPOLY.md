# ðŸŽ² Quick Start Guide - Monopoly Game

## What's New

I've completely transformed your game into a **classic Monopoly game** with:
- Full 40-space Monopoly board
- Dice rolling mechanics
- Property buying
- Player pieces that move around the board
- Color selection in lobby
- Turn-based gameplay
- Beautiful, modern UI

## Setup (5 Minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend  
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Database

Edit `backend/database/index.js` and update your PostgreSQL connection:

```javascript
const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  // Add your PostgreSQL credentials here
});
```

Or set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

### 3. Initialize Database

```bash
cd backend
node database/setup.js
```

This will create all the Monopoly tables.

### 4. Run the Game

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
