# ðŸ”„ Restart Instructions

## What to Do NOW:

1. **Stop your backend server** (Ctrl+C in the terminal)

2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Go to homepage** and click "Create Game"

4. **The database will auto-initialize** on first game creation

## What's Fixed:

âœ… Database auto-initializes when creating games  
âœ… No more "relation 'properties' does not exist" errors  
âœ… Paths corrected to find the schema file  
âœ… Schema copied to the right location  

## If It Still Fails:

Run this once:
```bash
cd backend
node database/setup.js
```

Then restart the server.
