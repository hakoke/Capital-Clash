Simple. Clear. Addictive.

---

## 🎮 Turn Structure (5 Rounds)

### **Your Turn** (~2 minutes)
Do ONE main action per turn:

1. **BUY PROPERTY** (if available & you have cash)
   - Click a tile
   - Confirm purchase
   - Pay the price → You own it

2. **UPGRADE PROPERTY** (if you own it)
   - Choose your property
   - Pay upgrade cost
   - Increases rent others pay

3. **LAUNCH COMPANY** (unlocks passive income)
   - Choose industry & district
   - Pay investment
   - Earn income each round

4. **AI ACTION** (optional, once per turn)
   - Type a creative action
   - AI responds with benefits/costs
   - Examples: "Bribe the mayor", "Launch PR campaign", "Sabotage a rival"

**End Turn** → Next player

---

### **End of Round: Passive Income Phase**

When all players finished their turn:
1. **Properties pay rent** → Owners collect from players on their tiles
2. **Companies generate income** → You earn from your businesses
3. **AI event happens** → Economic twist (rent multipliers, bonuses, crises)
4. **News report** → AI narrates what happened

Then next round begins.

---

## 📊 Property Income

### **Rent System** (The Addictive Hook)

Owned properties collect **automatic rent** at round end:
- **Base rent:** Property price × 10%
- **Upgraded rent:** Property price × 25%
- **AI multiplier:** +50% (boom) or -30% (crisis)

**Example:**
- You own "Tech Park Plot 1" (purchased for $200k)
- Base rent: $20k per round
- Upgraded: $50k per round
- Boom multiplier: +$25k = **$75k total!**

**The more properties you own, the more passive income you generate.**

---

## 🏢 Companies (Passive Income Engines)

Launch companies to earn **guaranteed income** each round:

| Company Type     | Cost    | Income/Round | Best In           |
|------------------|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Tech Startup     | $250k   | $30k         | Tech Park         |
| Retail Store     | $150k   | $20k         | Downtown          |
| Factory          | $300k   | $35k         | Industrial        |
| Eco Firm         | $200k   | $25k         | Green Valley      |
| Media Agency     | $350k   | $40k         | Luxury Mile       |
| Shipping Co.     | $280k   | $32k         | Harborfront       |

**Companies exist independently** — even if you lose money on properties, your companies keep earning.
