## 🔄 How Dynamicity Works

### 1. AI Generates Event
- AI creates ANY event based on game state
- No restrictions on content
- Creative and dramatic

### 2. Event Changes Game Values
```javascript
// Event can change:
district.market_value += event.marketChanges[d.name]
player.capital += event.playerImpacts[p.name].capitalChange
player.reputation += event.playerImpacts[p.name].reputationChange
tile.current_value = calculateNewValue()
```

### 3. Database Updates
```javascript
// All changes saved to database
UPDATE districts SET market_value = ?
UPDATE players SET capital = ?, reputation = ?
UPDATE tiles SET current_value = ?
```

### 4. Frontend Receives Updates
```javascript
// Via WebSocket or polling
socket.emit('game_update', {
  districts: updatedDistricts,
  players: updatedPlayers,
  news: newEvent
})
```

### 5. UI Updates in Real-Time
- Prices change visually
- Districts darken/light up
- Players see elimination messages
- News panel shows story
- Leaderboard updates

## 💾 Real-Time Reflection

### Database → Frontend Flow:

1. **AI generates event** with market changes
2. **Backend updates database** with new values
3. **WebSocket broadcasts** updates to all players
4. **Frontend receives update** via socket or polling
5. **React re-renders** with new data
6. **Players see changes** immediately

### Example Real-Time Update:

```javascript
// AI Event Generated
{
  district: "Downtown",
  priceChange: -50000
}

// Database Updated
UPDATE tiles SET current_value = current_value - 50000 
WHERE district_id = 'downtown'

// Broadcast to Frontend
io.to('game_123').emit('update', {
  districts: [{name: "Downtown", market_value: 150000}],
  message: "Downtown prices have crashed by $50k"
})

// Frontend Updates
setDistricts(updatedDistricts) // React re-renders
setNews([...currentNews, newEvent]) // News appears
```

## 🎮 Player Experience

### During Game:

✅ **See dynamic price changes** on tiles
✅ **Read dramatic events** in news panel
✅ **Get eliminated** if event says so
✅ **District gets destroyed** → see it grayed out
✅ **Capital changes** in real-time
✅ **Reputation fluctuates** with events
✅ **Watch news stories** about YOUR actions

### Example Player Journey:

```
Round 1: Player buys Downtown tiles
Event: "Downtown boom - prices +20%"
Result: Your tiles are now worth 20% more!

Round 3: You have $2M capital
Event: "Market crash - you lose 50% capital"  
Result: Now you have $1M

Round 5: You own Tech Park
Event: "Tech Park attacked by hackers - district disabled"
Result: Your district is grayed out, you lost your investment

Round 7: You're winning
Event: "CEO murdered - you're eliminated"
Result: You can now spectate, leaderboard shows elimination
```
